## Data Sources  

These are the input files that were used as source for this project based on the instructions:
- **Train set:** 'train/X_train.txt'
- **Test set:** 'test/X_test.txt'
- **Training labels:** 'train/y_train.txt'
- **Test labels:** 'test/y_test.txt'
- **Activity labels:** 'activity_labels.txt' (Links the class labels with their activity name.)
- **Feature List:** 'features.txt'
- **Subject Lists (2):** 'subject_train.txt' (Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Two lists exist: one for the Train set and another one for the Test set.)

## Data Processing  

The following are the data processing, transformation, and summarization steps that were performed in order to generate the final deliverable. The R code that implements these steps is in file "run_analysis.R".    

**1. Loaded all the input files in R Dataframes.** These were the steps followed for that purpose: Read the text of the file into a character vector, split the lines using spaces as separators, removed empty values (if they existed), converted the resulting vector to a matrix with the same number of rows than the input file, and finally transformed the matrix into an R data frame. These steps were followed for all input files individually.  
**2. Labeled the datasets with descriptive variable names.** For the train and test feature datasets, I used the descriptions imported from the "features.txt" file as a starting point, and then I improved upon those names (before saving the final results) in order to make those names easier to read and understand. For the rest of the files I assigned my own descriptive names.  
**3. Added descriptive names to name the activities in the data set.** Used the activity descriptions imported from the "activity_labels.txt"   
 file.  Merged those descriptions with the exercise data joining by activity ID.  
**4. Integrated all the training and testing datasets into one master dataset.** Joined the subject, feature, and activity datasets column-wise. Then joined the resulting training and testing datasets row-wise. The result was a master dataset with 10299 rows x 564 columns.  
**5. Extracted the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.**  Identified those measurement based on the descriptive variable names. Removed all the unnecesary columns from the dataset.  Kept only the grouping factors (subject & activity) plus the variables requested by the project instructions (mean & standard deviation metrics.)  The result was a master dataset with 10299 rown x  89 columns.  
**6. Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.**  Aggregated the data by subject and activity (as grouping factors) and applied a mean function to all the remaining fields in the dataset.  
**7. Saved the result.**  The final deliverable was saved as "Second_Result_Averages.csv"
