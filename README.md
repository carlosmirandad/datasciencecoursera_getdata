Getting and Cleaning Data Project
===========================

This repository (*datasciencecoursera_getdata*) contains my final project submission for the Coursera class "Getting and Cleaning Data" from John Hopkins University.  

This "README" document explains the purpose and contents of the three (3) files that I am submitting for this project:  
**1. File "Second_Result_Averages.csv":** This is the final result, a tidy data set created according to the instructions in the project description that can be used for analysis.  
**2. File "run_analysis.R":** This is the R program that reads the downloaded data, performs all the aggregations and transformations requested in the instructions, and saves the final result file.  
**3. File "CodeBook.md":** A document that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.  

In this project we analyze "Human Activity Recognition" data collected using Smartphones. This is the [website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) from were the data was obtained.
