<p>This document is part of the final project submission for the Coursera class &ldquo;Getting and Cleaning Data&rdquo; organized by John Hopkins University. The purpose of this document is to describe the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.  </p>

<hr/>

<h2>Final Deliverable</h2>

<p>File &ldquo;Second_Result_Averages.csv&rdquo; contains the final deliverable of this project: this is a tidy data set that can be used for analysis and it was created according to the instructions in the project description.  </p>

<hr/>

<h2>Variable Description</h2>

<p>The final dataset in the project contains the following 89 variables:</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>

<p>These are the input files that were used as source for this project based on the instructions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Train set:</strong> &#39;train/X_train.txt&#39;</li>
<li><strong>Test set:</strong> &#39;test/X_test.txt&#39;</li>
<li><strong>Training labels:</strong> &#39;train/y_train.txt&#39;</li>
<li><strong>Test labels:</strong> &#39;test/y_test.txt&#39;</li>
<li><strong>Activity labels:</strong> &#39;activity_labels.txt&#39; (Links the class labels with their activity name.)</li>
<li><strong>Feature List:</strong> &#39;features.txt&#39;</li>
<li><strong>Subject Lists (2):</strong> &#39;subject_train.txt&#39; (Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Two lists exist: one for the Train set and another one for the Test set.)</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Data Processing</h2>

<p>The following are the data processing, transformation, and summarization steps that were performed in order to generate the final deliverable. The R code that implements these steps is in file &ldquo;run_analysis.R&rdquo;.    </p>

<p><strong>1. Loaded all the input files in R Dataframes.</strong> These were the steps followed for that purpose: Read the text of the file into a character vector, split the lines using spaces as separators, removed empty values (if they existed), converted the resulting vector to a matrix with the same number of rows than the input file, and finally transformed the matrix into an R data frame. These steps were followed for all input files individually.<br/>
<strong>2. Labeled the datasets with descriptive variable names.</strong> For the train and test feature datasets, I used the descriptions imported from the &ldquo;features.txt&rdquo; file as a starting point, and then I improved upon those names (before saving the final results) in order to make those names easier to read and understand. For the rest of the files I assigned my own descriptive names.<br/>
<strong>3. Added descriptive names to name the activities in the data set.</strong> Used the activity descriptions imported from the &ldquo;activity_labels.txt&rdquo;<br/>
 file.  Merged those descriptions with the exercise data joining by activity ID.<br/>
<strong>4. Integrated all the training and testing datasets into one master dataset.</strong> Joined the subject, feature, and activity datasets column-wise. Then joined the resulting training and testing datasets row-wise. The result was a master dataset with 10299 rows x 564 columns.<br/>
<strong>5. Extracted the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</strong>  Identified those measurement based on the descriptive variable names. Removed all the unnecesary columns from the dataset.  Kept only the grouping factors (subject &amp; activity) plus the variables requested by the project instructions (mean &amp; standard deviation metrics.)  The result was a master dataset with 10299 rown x  89 columns.<br/>
<strong>6. Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</strong>  Aggregated the data by subject and activity (as grouping factors) and applied a mean function to all the remaining fields in the dataset.<br/>
<strong>7. Saved the result.</strong>  The final deliverable was saved as &ldquo;Second_Result_Averages.csv&rdquo;   </p>
